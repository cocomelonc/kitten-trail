Kitten Trail contains no recorded, sampled, or third-party audio. Its star,
level-complete, and journey-complete chimes are synthesized at runtime by
`AudioEngine.java`. The quiet 12-second kitten lullaby is an original
composition synthesized and looped at runtime by `MusicEngine.java`.

Both the audio code and the composition encoded by its note data are original
project work and are available under the repository's [MIT License](LICENSE).
They may be used, modified, and distributed under that license.

Background music plays only during an active level. It stops on pause, title,
completion, app backgrounding, and view destruction, and it uses Android Audio
Focus so calls, accessibility tools, and other media can take priority.
